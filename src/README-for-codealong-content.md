# Concepts
#### During the Sprint 1 - 2 themed code-alongs, we'd just be looking at buttons on screen and primarily focused on console logs in dev tools.
#### During Sprint 3 themed code-alongs, we would build out the GUI

## Unit 1 Sprint 1 Modules 1 & 2
### Git for Web Development and Intro to JS
#### Instructor thoughts: Learners tend to struggle most with params and args in this section, so focus on that during code-along. Basics like variables, loops, if/else statements etc will be integrated into later codealongs as we build functionality.
- [ ] Set up branch of the day and show them how to merge at the end?
- [ ] Set up all shells of functions being used in onClicks in App.js, just fill with console.logs to prove functionality (discuss params)
- [ ] Set up all onClicks on buttons in App.js (discuss args)
- [ ] Appropriate committing + pushing habits throughout

## Unit 1 Sprint 1 Modules 3 & 4
### Arrays and Objects
- [ ] Comment in first section of buttons in App.js
- [ ] Write hasCorrectFormat() located in data-clean.js; apply it inside cleanDates() located in data-clean.js (non-inclusive of styling)
- [ ] Write for... in... loop content inside cleanupUndefinedKeys located in data-clean.js

## Unit 1 Sprint 2 Modules 1 & 2
### Scope & Closure and Advanced Array Methods
NOTE: Filtering.js functionality not fully written.
- [ ] Build one specific sort function (ex: sortByState()) in sorting.js
- [ ] Convert to more generic sort function (sortByKey()) in sorting.js
- [ ] Build out filtering.js in the same way using filter/map/etc

## Unit 1 Sprint 2 Modules 3 & 4
### Prototypes & Inheritance and Classes
I think I would need ideas on how to integrate this one into here tbh. Might need a little standalone lesson for this one? Could potentially create a class to structure something around.

## Unit 1 Sprint 3 Modules 1 & 2
### User Interface and Intro to CSS
- [ ] Create card component structure
- [ ] Intro to dev tools
- [ ] Add some very basic styling with box model, e.g. give h/w to User cards, change background color, etc.
- [ ] Add .formatted key and functionality to the objects in code for conditional styling

## Unit 1 Sprint 3 Modules 3 & 4
### CSS Layouts and Responsive Design
NOTE: This code does not exist yet.
- [ ] Update box model code to flexbox as much as possible
- [ ] Intro to responsive functionality in dev tools
- [ ] Update units to be responsive, add viewport tag
